  This question is used to introduce your interview. Please customize
id: Delegation_of_parental_authority
continue button field: delegation_of_parental_authority_intro
question: |
  Delegation of parental authority
subquestion: |
  This interview will help you delegation of parental authority. A Delegation of Parental Authority (DOPA) is a document that lets someone take care of your children when you can’t. The person you give this permission to is called an “Attorney-in-Fact.” The Attorney-in-Fact does not need to be a licensed attorney. 
  
  When you are finished, you will need to:
  
  1. Sign the document (in the presence of a notary);
  2. Have the Attorney-in-Fact sign the document (in the presence of a notary);
  3. Have the document signed by a notary;
  4. File with the court. 
  
  Most people take about 10 minutes to finish this interview.

  This question is not likely to be used as-is, because the user
  is likely to need to know which children to list on the form.
  
  That will be very context-specific.
